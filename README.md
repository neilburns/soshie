soshie
======

Soshie is a social platform and event aggregator that allows users to create and browse public events. For demonstration purposes, all events are displayed, as opposed to only the events within a user's geofence; this can be changed by modifying the routes, of course. Asynchronous technology allows the app to exist on a single page, despite its apparent complexity.
